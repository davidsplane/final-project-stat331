# final-project-stat331

### This is a package by David Splane for my final project in STAT331. This package is a compilation of functions that, in retrospect, would've helped me adjust to R coming from a Python background (I've really only taken CPE101 in Python and now CPE202 in Python; R is a lot harder). There are two miscellaneous functions, quotefromPatrick() and judge_team(), that are little side functions for fun. Or for certain use; how it is utilized is not up to me. The other six (?) functions were mainly pertaining to datasets and quickly filtering or mutating them. I think my favorite function here is the significance_level_concl() since I'm not great with tibbles and yeah.
